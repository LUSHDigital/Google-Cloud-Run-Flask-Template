## üìñ About <a name = "about"></a>
A template for developing and deploying a [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run/) Python app, with a ready to use local development environment, automated builds and lots of optional extras.

## üëü Quickstart <a name = "quickstart"></a>

__üí•Just get me a Cloud Run Python App!üí•__

The quickest way to get started is it fork this repo and deploy using Terraform ([see how here](#continuous-deployment-from-github-via-terrafrom)).

Then make your code changes in [/app](app), commit and push to GitHub, this will trigger a automatic build and deployment, you'll see your app building at [console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers), once built you'll find your app at [console.cloud.google.com/run](https://console.cloud.google.com/run).

## üíª Local Development & Live Debugging <a name = "local_development"></a>

> Requirements: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).


The app can be built with `docker-compose build` and then run with `docker-compose run`. After which you'll be able to view the app at [localhost:80](http://localhost:80/).

The application lives in [/app](app), a "Hello World" Flask app has been supplied by default but you can of course change this to whatever you prefer.

There is also a [Hug](https://www.hug.rest/) template available, see [Hug not Flask](hug-not-flask).

Any changes to the code will be reflected after a page refresh.


## üöÄ Deploying to Cloud Run<a name = "deploying"></a>

- [Deployment Option A - Continuous Deployment from Github via Terraform](#continuous-deployment-from-github-via-terrafrom)
- [Deployment Option B - One off Deployment](#one-off-deployment)
- [Deployment Option C - Continuous Deployment from Github via gCloud](#continuous-deployment-from-github-via-gcloud)

### Deployment Option A -  Continuous Deployment from Github via Terrafrom <a name = "continuous-deployment-from-github-via-terrafrom"></a>

> Requirements: [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

1. run `terraform init` to make sure you have everything you need, Terraform will prompt for permission to pull any missing requirements.

2. Update [variables.tf](../variables.tf) with your information.

3. run `terraform apply `, Terraform will show you what it intends to do, type `yes` to deploy.

### Deployment Option B -  One-off Deployment <a name = "one-off-deployment"></a>

> Requirements: [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install).

**As Cloud Run is in Beta you'll need to install the gcloud beta component:**

`gcloud components install beta`.

**Using Cloud Build, build and host your image:**

`gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/[PROJECT-ID]/helloworld`
Replacing [PROJECT-ID] with your GCP project ID. You can view a list of projects available to you by using `gcloud projects list`.

**Deploy your image to Cloud Run:**

You can either deploy your app through the web UI at [cloud.google.com/run](https://cloud.google.com/run) or by via the command-line as shown below.

`gcloud beta run deploy --image gcr.io/[PROJECT-ID]/helloworld`
Again replacing [PROJECT-ID] with your GCP project ID.

When prompted, select region us-central1 as Cloud Run is currently only available here, confirm the service name, and respond y to allow unauthenticated invocations.

Wait a few moments until the deployment is complete. On success, the command line displays the service URL.

### Deployment Option C - Continuous Deployment from Github via gCloud <a name = "continuous-deployment-from-github-via-gcloud"></a>

> Requirements: [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/install).

#### 1. Edit cloudbuild.yaml

In the repository root edit cloudbuild.yaml by replacing **[SERVICE-NAME]** and **[REGION]** with the name and region of the Cloud Run service you are deploying to.

#### 2. Grant the "Cloud Run Admin" and "Service Account User" roles to the Cloud Build service account

We'll need to need to know the name of your Cloud Build service account, it will have the suffix *@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com*.

You can find it using the following:

`gcloud projects get-iam-policy [PROJECT-ID] | grep @cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com`
Replacing [PROJECT-ID] with your GCP project ID.

Once we know the Cloud Build service account we can grant the *run.admin* role to allow Cloud Build to manipulate Cloud Run resources, and the *iam.serviceAccountUser* role to allow Cloud Build to act as other service accounts, which include your Cloud Run services, by using the following:

 `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member='[SERVICE-ACCOUNT]' --role='roles/run.admin'`

 `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member='[SERVICE-ACCOUNT]' --role='roles/iam.serviceAccountUser'`

Again, in both, replacing [PROJECT-ID] with your GCP project ID, and [SERVICE-ACCOUNT] with the account discovered in the previous step.

#### 3. Create a Build Trigger

*We'll need to do this part using the cloud.google.com site as there is not yet a way to create a build trigger through gcloud, see [this issue](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders/issues/99) if you are interested in more information.*

1. Visit the [Cloud Build triggers page](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers)

2. Click Create Trigger.

3. From the displayed repository list, select your repository and click Continue. For more information on specifying which branches to autobuild, see [Creating a build trigger](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/running-builds/automate-builds#creating_a_build_triggerr).

4. Select cloudbuild.yaml in Build Configuration.

5. Click Create.

**You're finished! From this point on, anytime you push to your repository, you automatically trigger a build and a deployment to your Cloud Run service.**

## üîß Optional Extras

### Connecting to GCP services

You can use Cloud Run with the supported GCP services using the client libraries provided by these products. For a list of services supported, and not [see here](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/using-gcp-services#services_and_tools_recommended_for_use).

There is plenty official documentation with examples of how to use Python client libraries for each GCP service, you may find it easier to read through these first but for quick reference some examples of common services has been supplied in [gcp-services-examples](gcp-services-examples). You will need to uncomment the relevant lines in `app/requirements.txt` for the GCP services that you use.

#### Connecting to GCP services in Cloud run

Note that Cloud Run uses a default runtime service account that has the **Project > Editor** role, which means it is able to call all GCP APIs. You do not need to provide credentials manually inside Cloud Run container instances when using the GCP client libraries.

#### Connecting to GCP services locally

When developing locally however you will need to supply credentials.

Create the service account. Replace **[NAME]** with a name for the service account.

1. `gcloud iam service-accounts create [NAME]`

Grant permissions to the service account. Replace **[PROJECT_ID]** with your project ID.

2. `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding [PROJECT_ID] --member "serviceAccount:[NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com" --role "roles/owner"`

Generate the key file and store it in the **service_account** directory of the repository.

`gcloud iam service-accounts keys create service_account/sa.json --iam-account [NAME]@[PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com`

### Hug not Flask

If you'd rather use [Hug](https://www.hug.rest/) instead of Flask you can delete the `app` direcory and rename [hug-app](hug-app) to `app`, you'll also need to edit [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) and remove the final `CMD` line, then uncomment the `CMD` line Hug.
